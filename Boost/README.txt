If you have troubles compiling you may need to change BOOST_LOCATION and BOOST_LIB_SUFFIX in the Makefile.

Tested with Boost v1.53 on Cygwin, Boost v1.44 on Fedora 14 Linux, and with Boost v1.73 and MinGW v7.3.0 on Windows 10.

ToDo:
- check for errors
- buffering
- command line options
- client implementation
